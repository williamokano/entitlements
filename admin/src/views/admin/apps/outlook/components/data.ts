Thank you for sharing the latest draft of the landing page. The new layout looks clean and intuitive, especially the improvements made to the hero section and the pricing table. I also appreciated how responsive the mobile version feels.

Here are a few suggestions:

* Update the CTA button color to match our brand palette (#3A86FF).
* Replace the placeholder text in the testimonial section.
* Add a subtle animation to the "Features" icons on hover.

Once these changes are in place, we can finalize the QA pass and move on to staging.
